- Total time: 25 minutes
- Equipment: air fryer, 3 shallow bowls, small bowl for sauce, whisk, tongs

## Ingredients

### Chicken
- 300 g chicken tenders (about 6)
- 1 egg, beaten
- 30 g plain flour
- 50 g cornflakes, crushed (use more for extra crunch)
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- Salt & pepper, to taste
- 10 sprays cooking oil (or 1–2 tbsp neutral oil)

### Bang Bang Sauce
- 100 g 0% fat Greek yogurt (or use mayo for richer sauce)
- 30 g sweet chilli sauce
- 1 tsp sriracha (adjust to taste)
- 20 g honey

### Finishing
- ~5 g extra sweet chilli sauce per tender (to smear on before dipping)

## Optional substitutions & notes
- Swap Greek yogurt for mayonnaise or a 50/50 mix for a creamier sauce.
- Use panko instead of cornflakes for a different texture.
- For gluten-free: use GF flour and GF cornflakes or crushed GF crackers.

## Method

1. Preheat the air fryer to 200°C (390°F).
2. Season the chicken tenders with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Set aside.
3. Prepare three shallow bowls: (A) flour, (B) beaten egg, (C) crushed cornflakes.
4. Coat each tender in flour, shake off excess, dip into the egg, then press into the crushed cornflakes until well coated.
5. Place coated tenders in the air fryer basket in a single layer (work in batches if needed). Lightly spray the tenders with cooking oil (about 10 sprays across the batch).
6. Air fry at 200°C (390°F) for 12–15 minutes, flipping once halfway through, until golden and cooked through (internal temperature 75°C / 165°F).
7. While the chicken cooks, make the Bang Bang Sauce: in a small bowl whisk together the Greek yogurt, 30 g sweet chilli sauce, sriracha, and honey until smooth. Taste and adjust sweetness/spice.
8. As each tender finishes, smear ~5 g extra sweet chilli sauce on it, then dip or drizzle with the Bang Bang sauce before serving.

## Serving suggestions
- Serve with steamed rice, a side salad, or in a wrap with shredded lettuce and sliced cucumber.
- Garnish with chopped spring onions and a squeeze of lime for brightness.

## Storage
- Store leftover cooked tenders in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in the air fryer at 180°C (350°F) for 3–5 minutes to regain crispiness.
- Store sauce separate for up to 3 days.

## Tips
- Crushing cornflakes finely helps them adhere better; leave some larger pieces for extra crunch.
- If the coating is falling off, press cornflakes onto the tender firmly and allow coated tenders to rest 5–10 minutes before air frying.
- For extra crispiness, spray oil both before and briefly halfway through cooking.
